# Deed Covenants: A TechTogether Atlanta Project
## Description
Tens of thousands of homes across the United States have covenants -- racist relics of a segregationist era -- and Atlanta's neighborhoods are no exception. Our application raises awareness of this situation and provides individuals a searchable database in which they can search and determine whether the property has a covenant. Additionally, they are provided resources for legal intervention and further learning about racial covenants.

## Features
1. **Add Covenants to Database**: Individuals can add to the Covenant Deed Database by inputting information about the property (e.g., address, date of issue, copy of deed). 
2. **Search Database for Covenants**: Individuals may search the database for an address and learn whether the deed is known to have a racial covenant.
3. **Autocomplete**: Individuals are aided by the Google Places Autocomplete API when entering in address locations, both on the Add Deed form and the Search Address form.  
4. **Information**: Individuals are provided historical information about racial deed covenants and present-day resources so they can continue their learning about these racist practices.

## Future Development
* Refine authorization component so that only database-registered administrators can add deeds to the database OR implement security practices which allow any user to upload a PDF of their deed.
* The application is currently focused on Atlanta, Georgia, and we would like to expand it to a wider geographic region.
* Bring this application to local governments so this application could have a positive impact on our communities.
